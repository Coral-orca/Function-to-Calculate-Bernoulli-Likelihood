## R Functions

A collection of R functions I use personally. Most of the filenames are self-explanatory. Variable documentation and function interactivity is available inside the Rscripts.

This is a code stash. Definitely not something maintained regularly or environment controlled or version controlled. Functions may break due R version changes or updates to R libraries and packages.

## Function Overview

*bernoulli-likelihood:* A function to compute and plot the likelihood function for the Bernoulli Distribution.
*excelesquer:* A shiny app to upload a dataset, and export single variable (histogram/density) or two variable (scatter/line) plots.
